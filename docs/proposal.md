## Summary of the Project
The goal of our project is to develop an AI agent that operates within a simulated Minecraft environment and navigates through obstacles to reach a designated finish line. The environment includes various challenges such as lava pits, which the agent must avoid, and ores that require identification and appropriate pickaxe selection for mining. The input to the system will be the real-time state of the Minecraft environment, including visual and positional data. The output will be the agent's actions, such as movement, tool selection, and decision-making for navigating obstacles. Applications for this project include developing intelligent agents for simulation environments and game-based AI problem-solving
