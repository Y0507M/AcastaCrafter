## Summary of the Project
The goal of our project is to develop an AI agent that can autonomously navigate and mine in an underground Minecraft environment. The environment includes various challenges such as lava pits, which the agent must avoid, and ores that require identification and appropriate pickaxe selection for mining. The input to the system will be the real-time state of the Minecraft environment, including visual and positional data. The output will be the agent's actions, such as movement, tool selection, and decision-making for navigating obstacles. Applications for this project include developing intelligent agents for simulation environments and game-based AI problem-solving.

## AL/ML Algorithm
We plan to use reinforcement learning methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), with neural network function approximators to train the agent, focusing on on-policy learning for efficient policy updates.

## Evalation Plan
TBD

## Meet the Instructor
Out first meeting with Professor Roy Fox will be on Jan. 23rd, 2025 at 10:30 AM.

## AI Tool Usage
In this project, we plan to use AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist with researching, brainstorming, coding, and debugging, while ensuring that these tools are not overly relied upon. We are aware that these AI tools can fail, so we will be using them both carefully and sparingly.
